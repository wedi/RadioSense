RSSI Measurement in a _Telos B_ Mote Network
=============================================

This software measures the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of IEEE 802.15.4 radio links in a network
of Telos B motes. It's capable of doing 100 measurements per second. It is build upon [TinyOS].


Assumptions
------------
  - All nodes can see each other.


Background
-----------
The origin of this code is the _Wireless Sensor Network Application Development Project_ supervised by [Dr. Matteo Cerriotti] at the [Network Embedded Systems Chair] at the University of Duisburg - Essen. It further evolved regarding speed and channel switching during Dirk's Bachelor thesis "_Analysis of the Impact of Device Positioning on Radio Tomographic Imaging_".
